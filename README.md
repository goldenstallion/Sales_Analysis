<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Focus on Technology sub-category, Office Machines, and Telephones and Communication they are among the highest selling and most profitable. we can promote it with less profitable product sub-category such as Office Furnishings, Tables, Pens & Art Supplies, Scissors, Rulers and Trimmers Labels Rubber Bands to offset the losses.</li>
    <li>Sales of Scissors, Rulers and Trimmers, Rubber Bands, Bookcases, and Tables results in huge losses, it's important that we bundle them with high selling and profittable product sub-category.</li>
    <li>Not specified order priority should be completely struck off, this will prevent customer's order from getting to them after 90 days.</li>
    <li>For Corporate customers, these people might be busy with work and less likely to spend time selecting individual products, we can create packages that best suits this type of customer.</li>
    <li>We should consider dropping from the catalogue products that incur losses on the company such as Scissors, Rulers and Trimmers, Rubber Bands, Bookcases, Tables. Alternatively, We can consider changing suppliers or bargain for a cheaper production cost.</li>
    <li> Manager Sam Smith recorded the least sales, profit and quantity sold, emphasis on the need to conduct analytical studies to ascertain the challenges experienced by the manager, also we should consider promoting the least profitable products with the most profitable products.</li>
    <li>Home Office and Corporate make up more than 60% of our orders. We should target customers in these categories, especially customers from the central and eastern regions in the top 10 cities.</li>
    <li>We can introduce special promotions and bundles for Home Office and Corporate customer segment. Sending these promotions as email will be effective as these customers are very busy but will have time to check their emails.</li>
